I am a data scientist with formal training and research experience in economics, statistics/econometrics, causal inference, and firm strategy/industrial organization. Currently I am finishing up a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Kentucky. 

On the work side of life, I'm a big fan of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), [**SQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/), [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), [**VSCodium**](https://github.com/VSCodium), and [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org//). On the personal side of life, I'm a big fan of Animal Crossing, dachshunds (I have a miniature demon named Jethro), coffee, The Witcher, and cozy digital fireplaces.

Always trying to make choices to assure that $$ u'(C_t) = (1+r)\beta E_t[u'(C_{t+1})] $$.
