I am a data scientist with formal training and research experience in statistics/econometrics, causal inference, and firm strategy/industrial organization. Currently I am finishing up a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Kentucky. 

On the work side of life, I'm a big fan of <span style="text-decoration: underline">[R](https://www.r-project.org/)</span>, [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium), and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//). On the personal side of life, I'm a big fan of Animal Crossing, dachshunds (I have a miniature demon named Jethro), coffee, The Witcher, and cozy digital fireplaces.
