## Thoughts on Price Discrimination and Experimentation

In light of a certain company getting itself into consumers’ bad graces in light of price experimentation, I’ve seen quite a few takes from data scientists and economists. Many of these takes have lamented that it’s such a shame - not just because the loss of such amazing data (which, yes, consumer level data on price-quantity? Yeah, that’s a dream), but because price discrimination is welfare improving. 

Although I can forgive an arbitrary data scientist not trained in the standard microeconomic theory PhD economists go through for this faulty claim, its absolutely unforgivable in my opinion for PhD economists to blindly argue that price discrimination is welfare improving. Depending on the nature of the price discrimination, *it can be welfare improving.* However, save for one case where it is always welfare improving, it is not a theoretical guarantee that price discrimination will improve welfare. Moreover, in the one case where welfare is guaranteed to improve, that improvement comes at the cost of all consumer surplus - the entire welfare gain is due to an increase in profits.

In this post, I review the basic theory of *perfect price discrimination*. Without a doubt, many firms in the age of “AI” pricing are using price experimentation as a means to approximate this mythical ideal. As we will see, for all the talk of wanting to make consumers better off with “personalization”, basic theory quickly reveals that firms likely dream of approximating this case due to the profits to be reaped. After reviewing the theory, I provide a simple simulated example that confirms the predictions.
